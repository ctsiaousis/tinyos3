/**
	@defgroup rlists  Resource lists
	@brief  A simple and fast list implementation.


	Overview
	--------

	This data structure is a doubly-linked circular list, whose implementation
	is based on the splicing operation. 

	In a circular list, the nodes form a ring. For example if a, b, and c
	are nodes, a ring may look like
	@verbatim
	+--> a --> b --> c -->+
	|                     |
	+<------<--------<----+
	@endverbatim
	where only the @c next pointer is drawn. The @c prev pointer of a node
	is always the opposite of @c next, i.e.,  @c p->next->prev==p->prev->next==p.
	In the following, we shall denote such a ring by [a,b,c]. Note that
	[b,c,a] and [c,a,b] are describing the same ring as [a,b,c]. A singleton ring
	has just one node, e.g., [a].

	The splicing operation between two rlnodes a and b means simply to
	swap their @c next pointers (also adjusting the 'prev' pointers appropriately).
	Splicing two nodes on different rings, joins the two rings. Splicing two
	nodes on the same ring, splits the ring. 
	For example, @c splice(a,c) on ring
	[a,b,c,d] would create two rings [a,d] and [b,c]. 
	A splice can be reversed by repeating it; continuing the previous example, 
	given rings [a,d] and [b,c], splice(a,c) will create ring [a,b,c,d] again.
	The precise definition of splice
	is the following:
	@code
	rlnode* splice(rlnode* a, rlnode* b) {
		swap(& a->next->prev, & b->next->prev);
		swap(& a->next, & b->next);
		return b;
	}
	@endcode
	In general, @c splice(a,b) applies the following transformation
	@verbatim
	[a, x...]  [b, y...]   ==>   [a, y..., b, x...]
	[a, x..., b, y...]     ==>   [a, y...]  [b, x...]
	@endverbatim

	To implement lists, an rlnode object is used 
	as _sentinel_,  that is, it holds no data and is not properly part of the 
	list. If L is the list node, then ring  [C, L, A, B]  represents the list {A,B,C}.
	The empty list is represented as [L].

	We now show some examples of list operations, implemented by splicing.
	Suppose that L is a pointer to the sentinel node of a list.
	Also, suppose that N is (pointer to) a node in a singleton ring [N]
	Then, the the following operation are implemented as shown (in pseudocode):
	@verbatim
	empty(L)              ::  return  L == L->next
	head(L)               ::  return  L->next
	tail(L)               ::  return  L->prev
	push_front(L, N)      ::  splice(L, N)
	push_back(L, N)       ::  splice(L->prev, N)
	pop_front(L)          ::  return splice(L, L->next)
	pop_back(L)           ::  return splice(L, L->prev) 
	remove(N)             ::  return splice(N->prev, N)
	insert_after(P, N)    ::  splice(P, N)
	insert_before(P, N)   ::  splice(P->prev, N)
	@endverbatim

	These operations can be used to perform other operations. For example,
	if L1 and L2 are two lists, then we can append the nodes of L2 to L1
	(leaving L2 empty), by the following two operations:
	@verbatim
	push_back(L1, L2);
	remove(L2);
	@endverbatim

	For more details on the implementation, please read the code of @ref util.h.

	Usage
	-----

	Resource lists are mostly useful as storage for lists of resources. The main type
	is the list node, type @c rlnode. Each @c rlnode object must be initialized before use,
	by calling either @c rlnode_init or @c rlnode_new.
	@code
	TCB* mytcb =...;
	FCB* myfcb =...;

	rlnode n1, n2;

	// The following four lines are equivalent 
	rlnode_init(& n1, mytcb); 
	rlnode_new(& n1)->tcb = mytcb;
	rlnode_init(& n1, NULL);  n1->tcb = mytcb;
	rlnode_new(& n1);  n1->tcb = mytcb;


	n1->fcb = myfcb;
	myfcb = n1->fcb;
	@endcode


	###  Creating lists

	A list is defined by a sentinel node. For example,
	@code
	rlnode mylist;  
	rlnode_new(&mylist);
	@endcode
	Note that, although we did not store a value into the sentinel node, we actually 
	could do so if desired.
	
	Once a list is created, it needs to be filled with data.
	There are routines for adding nodes to the head and tail of a list, or in an intermediate
	location. Also, lists can be compared for equality, have their length taken, checked for
	emptiness, etc.
	@see rlist_push_front
	@see rlist_push_back

	### Intrusive lists

	In order to add nodes to a list, we must allocate @c rlnode objects somewhere in memory.
	It is absolutely legal to use `malloc()` for this purpose, but we must add code to free
	the allocated memory, which can be annoying.

	If we wish to store objects of a particular kind however, we can use a different technique:
	we can store an rlnode pointer inside the object itself. A list built by this trick is called
	an *intrusive list*.

	For example, suppose we want to
	maintain a list of TCBs with high priority.
	@code
	rlnode hi_pri_list;  rlnode_new(&hi_pri_list);

	struct thread_control_block {
	 .... // other stuff
	 rlnode hi_pri_node;
	};

	// initialize the node
	TCB* newtcb = ...;
	rlnode_init(& newtcb->hi_pri_node, newtcb);

	// then, we can just add the node to the list
	rlist_push_back(& hi_pri_list, & newtcb->hi_pri_node);
	@endcode

	Because node @c hi_pri_node is stored inside the object, it is always available. The node
	can be removed and re-added to this or another list, and memory allocation/deallocation
	is not an issue.
	The implementation of tinyos3 uses this idea very extensively, in TCB, PCB and FCB.

/**
	@defgroup exceptions  An execption-like library.

	@brief An exception-like mechanism for C

	Exceptions are supported by many object-oriented languages,
	such as Java, C++ and Python, but not by C. This makes programming
	certain kinds of tasks somewhat complicated. These are
	tasks that can cause a thread to exit back through several layers of
	calls.  For example, a system call may lead to a stack of nested
	calls to execute the code of a driver. If processing is to be
	rolled back to the point of entry to the kernel, all calls in that
	stack need to propagate the error. This makes coding tedious and
	error-prone.

	In C, there is a standard-library facility that can be used to 
	implement such functionality, available by including `<setjmp.h>`.
	The help is in the form of functions @c setjmp() and @c longjmp 
	(and their vatiatons). In this 	library, these standard calls, 
	wrapped by some suitable macros, and using some GNU GCC extensions
	(nested functions),	provide some easy-to-use exception-like programming 
	structures.

	## Examples

	Before we describe the details, we show some examples of the library's
	use.

	A try-block is declared as follows:
	@code
	TRY_WITH(context) {

		ON_ERROR {
			printf("Error in what I was doing\n");
			// After this, execute the finally 
		}

		FINALLY(e) {
			if(e) 
				printf("Continuing after error\n");			
			else
				printf("Finished without error\n");
		}

		// do something here 
		if(error_happens)
			raise_exception(context);

		// or call a function that may call raise_exception()
		do_something_else();

		// If we leave here, FINALLY will be executed 
	}
	@endcode

	For example, one could do the following, to construct a
	composite resource:
	@code
	Resource r1, r2, r3;
	TRY_WITH(context) {
		lock_monitor();
		FINALLY(e) {
			unlock_monitor();
		}

		// This may raise_exception(...)
		r1 = acquire_resource1();
		ON_ERROR {
			release_resource1(r1);
		}

		// This may raise_exception(...)
		r2 = acquire_resource2(r2);

		ON_ERROR {
			release_resource2(r2);
		}
		
		// This may raise_exception(...)
		r3 = acquire_resrouce3(r1, r2);
	}
	return r3;
	@endcode

	## How it works

	The workings are based on the idea of an **exception stack**. The elements
	of this stack are called __exception stack frames__ (ESFs). Each thread should
	have its own exception stack. 
	When a TRY_WITH(...) block begins, a new ESF is pushed to the stack, and the
	block starts to execute. 
	
	Each ESF has two lists of functions of type @ exception_handler, which is defined 
	as  `void (*)(int)`. The nodes for these lists are `struct exception_handler_frame`
	objects.  Initially, the new ESF has empty lists.  The first list is the list
	of **catchers** and the second is the list of **finalizers**.

	As the TRY-block executes, execution reaches `FINALLY()` and `ON_ERROR` blocks.
	When a `FINALLY()` block is reached, a new handler is added to the finalizers list.
	When a `ON_ERROR` block is reached, a new handler is added to the catchers list.

	If execution arrives at the end of the TRY-block, the list of catchers is thrown
	away and the finalizers are executed (in reverse order, that is, last-in-first-out).

	If at some point the function `raise_exception()` is called, execution jumps
	back at the TRY-block at the top of the exception stack. There, each catcher is
	first executed, followed by all the finalizers. At the end, the ESF is popped 
	from the exception stack. Then, if at least one catcher 
	did execute, the exception is considered handled, and execution continues after
	the TRY-block. If however there was no catcher executed, and the exception stack
	is non-empty, then `raise_exception()` is called again, to repeat the process.

	An exception stack is defined simply as a pointer to `struct exception_stack_frame`.
	An __exception context__is a pointer to such a pointer, that is,
	@code
	typedef struct exception_stack_frame** exception_context;
	@endcode
	A context needs to be available to our code in two places: when a 
	`TRY_WITH(context)` block is defined, and when `raise_exception(context)` is
	called.
	
	One can simply define a context as a global variable:
	@code
	// at top level
	struct execution_stack_frame* exception_stack = NULL;
	#define TRY  TRY_WITH(&exception_stack)
	#define RAISE  raise_exception(&exception_stack)

	TRY {
		...
		RAISE;
		...
	}
	@endcode

	In a multi-threaded case, it is necessary to declare one context for each
	thread. This can be done at the TCB, for example.

	@code
	struct TCB {
		....
		struct execution_stack_frame* exception_stack = NULL;	
	}

	#define TRY  TRY_WITH(& CURTHREAD->exception_stack)
	#define RAISE  raise_exception(& CURTHREAD->exception_stack)
	@endcode

	## Performance

	Although setting up a TRY-block is relatively cheap (basically, a call to
	`setjmp` is done), it is better to avoid calling exception handlers.
	So, for very critical pieces of code, one could do
	@code
	TRY {
		lock_mutex();
		ON_ERROR {
			unlock_mutex();
		}

		... // stuff
	
		unlock_mutex();
	}
	@endcode
	instead of the more convenient
	@code
	TRY {
		lock_mutex();
		FINALLY(e) {
			unlock_mutex();
		}

		... // stuff	
	}
	@endcode

	The first case is faster, because it avoids a function call, when there is
	no exception, whereas the second will make a call to the `FINALLY` block, even
	without an exception raised. But, remember: __premature optimization is the
	source of all evil__.

	## Raising from inside an exception handler

	It is perfecly legal and supported to have exceptions raised from inside
	`ON_ERROR` or `FINALLY` blocks (or the functions they call).

	What happens in this case is that the exception handler execution is aborted
	and the processing continues with the next exception handler of the ESF.
