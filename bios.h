	@brief The Virtual Machine API

	This file contains the API for a virtual machine (simulated computer) 
	which we will refer to as VM. This VM is used to implement tinyos3 on.

	The VM has a multicore CPU and peripherals.

	A simulation starts by calling function @c vm_boot. The description of the
	VM (currently, the number of simulated cores and the number of terminal
	devices), and also the initial function executed by each 
	core at boot time, are given as arguments.

	The VM (virtual) hardware is controlled by a BIOS (Basic I/O System) through
	the BIOS API. We now describe the concepts of the BIOS in detail.

	CPU
	---

	A CPU has 1 or more cores. Each core executes independently of each other.
	Variable cpu_core_id contains the id number of the current core.

	Interrupts
	----------

	Each CPU core has its own interrupt vector---it can set its own interrupt 
	handlers, independently of other cores. Setting an interrupt handler
	to @c NULL (the default), ignores the interrupt for this core.

	- When an interrupt handler executes, interrupts are initially disabled.

	- Interrupts can also be enabled and disabled programmatically.

	- If an interrupt is raised while interrupts are disabled, it will be marked as
	raised and the interrupt handler (if non-NULL) will be called as soon as 
	interrupts are re-enabled.

	- The <b>ICI</b> (Inter-Core Interrupt) interrupt can be sent from one core to
	another (or to itself!).

	Peripherals
	-----------

	The peripherals are managed via the 'bios_...' functions. 

	There are two types of simulated peripherals:  _timers_ and _serial ports_ 
	(connected to terminals). Each type of peripheral is documented below.

	Timers
	-------

	Each simulated core has its own timer. A timer can be activated by initializing
	it with some time interval. When the timer expires, the ALARM interrupt is raised 
	for the core.

	Serial ports
	------------- 

	The virtual machine has a number of serial ports connected to terminals.

	Each serial port/terminal can support reading and writing of single bytes.
	The reads return keyboard input, whereas the writes send characters to display
	on the screen.

	Terminals are numbered from 0, up to @c MAX_TERMINALS-1. 

	Implementation-wise, for each terminal/serial port, two 
	Unix named pipes must exist in the current
	directory:  one named  con@f$ N @f$ and one named kbd@f$ N @f$, where @f$ N @f$ is the
	number of the serial port. For example, if the computer has 2 serial ports,
	the following named pipes must be defined in the current directory at runtime:
	con0 kbd0 con1 kbd1

	Also, program  'terminal' must be executed twice (in two different windows):
	
	./terminal 0

	./terminal 1

	Data can be read from  a serial port, one byte at a time. A read
	may fail if the device is not-ready to perform the operation. On a device
	which is ready, the read will succeed. When a non-ready device becomes ready,
	a @c SERIAL_RX_READY interrupt is raised.

	Data can be written to a serial port, one byte at a time. A write
	may fail if the device is not-ready to perform the operation. On a device
	which is ready, the write will succeed. When a non-ready device becomes ready,
	a @c SERIAL_TX_READY interrupt is raised.

	Also, each interrupt is sent if the serial device timeouts (is inactive for
	about 300 msec).
