	@defgroup Testing  Unit Testing Library

	@brief A simple but powerful library for writing and executing tests. 


	Overview
	--------

 	Using this library, it is very easy to code unit tests for your code.
 	Let us start with an example.
 	@code
 	#include "unit_testing.h"

 	BARE_TEST(my_test, "This is a silly test")
 	{
		ASSERT(1+1==2);
		ASSERT(2*2*2 < 10);
 	}

	TEST_SUITE(all_my_tests, "These are mine")
	{
		&my_test,
		NULL
	};

	int main(int argc, char** argv) 
	{
		return register_test(&all_my_tests) || 
                run_program(argc, argv, &all_my_tests);
	}
	@endcode

	Reading through the above code should be mostly self-explanatory. 
	You can now compile and run the above program:
	@verbatim
	$ ./test_example 
	running suite: all_my_tests  [cores=1, terminals=0]
	        my_test                           : ok
	        suite all_my_tests completed [tests=1, failed=0]
	all_my_tests                      : ok
	@endverbatim

	It is possible to see the tests that you defined:
	@verbatim
	$ ./test_example -l
	all_tests_available          
	        all_my_tests                 
	                my_test  
	@endverbatim
	
	To see more options, you can run your program with the --help flag.


	Writing tests
	---------------

	A unit test should be testing one aspect of your code at a time. Writing 
	big tests which try to test for everything is not a good practice. Tests
	can be quite simple sometimes, or quite complex, but they should be focused. 
	Also, setting up a test may require you to write other functions (besides 
	the test code). 

	For less experienced programmers, writing test is sometimes hard, because
	their code is not __testable__. Writing testable code requires thought, 
	good programming practices (small, focused functions with a clean API,
	clean data structures, comments) and a willingness to rewrite code in order
	to make it more _beautiful_. Beautiful, well-structured code is by necessity 
	testable.

	Each test is a function, declared in some special way (like in the example,
	where we declared a `BARE_TEST`), so that the library will be able to find it
	and execute it automatically. When a test executes, it can call the code 
	it is testing, and check that it is working correctly, by use of two macros:

	- The @c assert(...)  macro from the standard library. Use this to check conditions
	that, if they fail, will cause the rest of the test to be skipped. For example,
	when we call a routine which returns a pointer to a new object, in order to test it,
	we would probably want to skip the rest of the test if the pointer returned is null.

	- The @c ASSERT(...)  macro is similar to the standard @c assert, but it does not
	cause the rest of the test to be skipped, even if it fails. It does however print
	a very nice message for you to read. Even better, using @c ASSERT_MSG(...) 
	you can have your own message printed, adding more information to help you
	understand better the cause of the problem.

	It is not a very good practice to print large amounts of messages from a test.
	But, if you really want to print some data, you can use the @c MSG(...) function.
	This function works just like @c printf, but prints the information indented,
	which is neater.

	Running tests
	-------------

	A test may fail for several reasons: some assertion did not hold, some signal 
	such as @c SIGSEGV or @c SIGILL was received, etc. Even if nothing like this
	happens, bugs may still exist, so that after running one test, the process is not
	reliable any more.

	In order to allow more than one test to run in every execution, each test is executed 
	in its own process; that is, before each test function is executed, there is a fork().
	Furthermore, when a test finishes, the process it used is destroyed. In order to guard 
	against tests that may get stuck (for example, in a deadlock), each test is only given
	a predetermined amount of time, which defaults at 10 seconds, but can be changed for
	individual tests that need more time. When this time expires, the process is killed
	and the test is considered a failure.
	In this way, each test runs in isolation, with only minimum overhead (creating a process
	is really fast).  An additional benefit is that test functions need not behave as
	good citizens, e.g., there is no need to clear the memory they allocate, or close any files
	etc.

	Sometimes, we wish to run a test function through the debugger, in order to explore some
	possible bug. Running tests in a different process makes it quite hard to work with
	the debugger. To allow this to happen, we can provide command-line option `--nofork`
	which instructs the library to execute tests in the original process. Usually, we
	would also provide a particular test to run. 
		

	Types of tests
	--------------

	There are different types of tests we may want to run. Some tests may check simple
	data structures or functions. These are **bare tests** and such was the test in the
	previous example.  But the library supports alse **boot tests**, which are tests 
	that run after booting the tinyos kernel. Finally, there is a third type of tests,
	**test suites**. A test suite is just a sequence of other tests (or test suites)
	which will execute one after the other. Test suites are useful for grouping related 
	tests together and giving them a name.

	Boot tests
	-----------

	Boot tests are a bit more complicated to execute that bare tests, because a virtual machine 
	has to boot, with some number of cores and serial devices. By default, boot tests
	are run with one core and no terminals. However, this can be changed by specifying
	at the command line the number of cores and the number of terminals to use. In
	fact, one can specify several combinations to run:
	@verbatim
	$  ./validate_api -c 1,2,3,4 -t 0,2
	@endverbatim
	The above line specifies that every boot test will be run 8 times, once for each
	combination of cores and terminals. 

    ### Terminal proxies.
     
    During boot tests, two functions can be used to test terminal I/O: @ref expect and @ref sendme.
	At the start of a boot test, the library creates a __terminal daemon thread__ for each terminal, which
	can be thought of as a user sitting at this terminal.
	The above functions are requests from the test to this daemon. Function @c expect tells the daemon
	that it should see a particular string on the screen, and @c sendme is a request that the daemon type at
	the keyboard the given string.
    Here is their usage in a test:
    @code
	file1 = OpenTerminal(1);     // open terminal 1

	sendme(1, "hello");

	char buffer[5];
	Read(file1, buffer, 5); 
	ASSERT( memcmp(buffer, "hello", 5) == 0 );

	expect(1, "hi there");
	Write(file1, "hi there", 8);
	@endcode

	Optional test parameters
	------------------------

	Some tests are meaningless when the number of cores or terminals is too small.
	It is possible to designate that such tests should be skipped, by setting 
	optional arguments during test definition. Another optional argument is the
	test timeout (amount of time within which the test must be completed).
	@verbatim
	BOOT_TEST(test_read_kbd_big,
	        "Test that we can read massively from the keyboard on terminal 0.",
	        .minimum_terminals = 1, .timeout = 20)
	{
		// ... stuff ...
	}
	@endverbatim
