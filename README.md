# TinyOS v.3

TinyOS is a very small operating system, built on top of a simple-minded virtual machine, whose purpose is
purely educational. It is not related in any way to the well-known operating system for wireless sensors,
but since it was first conceived in 2003, there was a name collision that I have not yet resolved.
This code (in its long history) has been used for many years to teach the Operating Systems course
at the Technical University of Crete.

In its current incarnation, tinyos supports a multicore preemptive scheduler, serial terminal devices, and a
unix like process model. It does not support (yet) memory management, block devices, or network devices. These
extensions are planned for the future.

## Quick start

After downloading the code, just build it.
```
$ make
```
If all goes well, the code should build without warnings. Then, you can run your first instance of tinyos,
a simulation of Dijkstra's Dining Philosophers.
```
$ ./mtask 1 0 5 5
FMIN = 27    FMAX = 37
*** Booting TinyOS

Then, you are ready to start reading the documentation (you will need `doxygen` to build it)
```
make doc
```
Point your browser at file  `doc/html/index.html`.  Happy reading!


### Build dependencies

Tinyos is developed, and will probably only run on Linux (its bios.c file uses Linux-specific system 
calls, in particular signal streams). Any recent (last few years) version of Linux should be sufficient.

Working with the code, at the basic level, requires a recent GCC compiler (with support for C11). The
standard packages `doxygen` and `valgrind` with their dependencies (e.g., `graphviz`) are also needed 
for anything serious, as well as the GDB debugger.

##### Χρήσιμα Guidelines
Θα χρειαστείτε καλή κατανόηση του GDB. Εύκολος, γρήγορος και διασκεδαστικός τρόπος για την χρήση του debugger πιστεύω πως είναι η κατανόηση του buffer overflow.
Πολύ καλό demonstration γίνεται από τα κανάλια στο youtube "Computerphile" & "LiveOverflow".
